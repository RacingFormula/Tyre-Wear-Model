# Tyre Wear Model

## Overview
This project simulates tyre degradation over a race distance. It models grip loss as a function of tyre wear and provides tools to estimate remaining tyre life.

## Features
- Tyre degradation simulation based on track roughness and temperature.
- Predictive tools to estimate grip loss and remaining tyre life.
- Visualisation of tyre performance trends.
